==== Current Task
	Current Aug Target > BitRunners starting with Neurolink / (done [Sector-12, Avernum, Tian, Voldhaven, Ishima , New Tokyo, Chongqing])


==== Faction Backdoors

	CyberSec - CSEC | req hack 56
	NiteSec - avmnite-02h | req hack 214
	TheBlackHand - I.I.I.I | req hack 353
	BitRunners - run4theh111z (is more than 10 deep from home, the-hub then nova-med) | req hack 545


==== port() list
	port 1 - for listner / exec waitRoot for getting root on hostname
	port 2 - for listner / exec builder against hostname
	port 3 - for listner / sets up selfHack against hostname
	port 4 - for listner / sets up managedHack against hostname
	port 5 - to be implemented / takes RAM return from buildBotnet, determines when we're ready for new target and builds a new botnet targeting that one


	port 20 - spider passes hostnames to this, supposed to build a list of servers 


==== todo
* botnet works to build servers
	need to rework removal to get rid of servers only when needed
	need to get ports working 
	listner set up to do managedHack (listner not working)

$ refactor all scripts to handle starting from 'new game'
	stage1 > no existing hacking tools, no port openers
				automate bitnodes
	stage2 > CashRoot aug for one port opener and 1m
				setup purchased servers
	stage3 > 

>	need to set up new postAug script that works....
	figure out the number of threads needed to not hack a server into not having money....
	start purchased servers on hacking 
		ports Needed 0 - "harakiri-sushi"
		ports Needed 1 - "iron-gym"
		ports Needed 2 - "phantasy" 
		ports Needed 3 - "rho-construction"

-	coding contracts, run on .cct

+	figure out the number and levels for hacknet to make it worth it?

__________SCRATCH__________

---- SPIDER
# spider [startFrom]
	scan startFrom
		for every name in the scan	
			scan that name
				if there isn't a file already with that name
					get the server details and write it to a file with that hostname in /targets/port0/ (a folder for every level of port that needs to be unblocked)

 * not working right, need to figure out the ports evidently

---- LISTNER
# home listner
	listens for hostname on port(1)
		if root on server and hostname != home or serv-[0-24] 
			write hostname to port(2)
		if not root
			exec waitRoot
	listens for hostname on port(2)
		if host has RAM && Money > 0
			exec builder
				// this takes the server to the max money and lowest security
	listens for hostname on port(3)
		scp selfHack to hostname
		exec for max threads
	listens for hostname on port(4)
		scp managedHack to hostname
		exec managedHack on hostname

---- HACKING
# builder [targetServer]
	runs as many threads as possible of weaken, grow, weaken at targetServer
	writes hostname to port(3) when done

# finding servers example 
	/** @param {NS} ns */
	export function getServers(ns) {
    	const servers = ['home'];
    	for (const server of servers)
        	ns.scan(server)
            	.filter((x) => !servers.includes(x))
            	.forEach((x) => servers.push(x));
    	return servers;
	}

	/** @param {NS} ns */
	export function getRootedServers(ns) {
    	for (const server of getServers(ns).filter((x) => !ns.hasRootAccess(x) && !ns.getPurchasedServers().includes(x) && x != 'home')) {
        	for (const tool of [ns.brutessh, ns.ftpcrack, ns.relaysmtp, ns.httpworm, ns.sqlinject, ns.nuke]) {
            	try {
                	tool(server);
            	}
            	catch (e) { }
       		}
    	}
    	return getServers(ns).filter((x) => ns.hasRootAccess(x));
	}


#	hackManager

	while don't have formulas
		do basic maxThread if loop wgh
	
	figure out the needed threads for getting a server to lowestSec and maxMoney and the number of hacks to not nuke it
		exec those as individual scripts to maxamize thread count
