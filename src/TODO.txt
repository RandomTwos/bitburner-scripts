==== Game Tasks
    stage-1
        hack all port0 server
        queue up self-hack on rooted servers
        build hacknet, purchase nodes and queue upgrades

    stage-2
        scan through servers
            try to root
            if sucessful self-hack
                if failed run script that will keep cycling through the failed servers to root then self-hack
        setup hack-manager-v1 on "home" to target 'best' server based on [MATH]
            give servers a value rating based on [growth * (max money / min security + 1)] //it's super arbitrary but it should do until v2
            if formulas.exe has been purchased or is avaliable
                spawn hack-manager-v2

    stage-3
        purchase servers, start with 8gb / loop replacing when current purchased server RAM * 2 is < 1/8 of current money on 'home'
        hack-manager-v2
            this one pawns off hwg threads to home / purchased server that's avaliable

    stage-4
        ?


==== Scripts Needed

# hacknet upgrade
    purchase as long as the cost of the hacknet upgrades if under 1/16 of avaliable money

# hack-manager-v1
    # spider
        gets a list of all avaliable server
            filter for opened ports && root && required hack level
                exec waitRoot on servers that have not been rooted
    
    while true

        # server rank
            based on list of server, assign hack value [growth * (max money / min security + 1)]
            add top x to targets

        for target in targets
            weaken to min
                execs weaken threads to get server to min security, if enough threads not avalible on the server queue them up in batches
        
            grow to max
                execs grow threads to get server to max money

            weaken to min
                execs weaken threads to get server to min security

            hack to 50%
                execs hack threads to get 50% of the server's money

# hack-manager-v2


# DAEMON 
    - if not joined factions at appropriate hack levels => popup
    - if not bought port openers at appropriate money || hack levels => toast

# map
    need to build a recursive search map that displays like scan-analyze but with just names 
        green has root and hackable
        yellow has root and under level
        orange not root but could
        red not root and not able to
        
        include bold if on the list of 'important' servers
        include italics if it's a company with stocks
        include @ if there are contracts on the server


# coding contracts
    idk, it's a thing

# stock markets
    idk, it's a thing


==== ARCHIVE
# self-hack
    convert the starting script
        expects the server to already be root
# setup-stage1
    copies self-hack to array of servers
    runs build-hacknet
# build hacknet
    buys hacknet nodes and upgraded them as longs as the price is under 1/4 of the money on 'home'
