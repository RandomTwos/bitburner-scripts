==== Game Tasks
    setup
        stage-1
            hack all port0 server
            queue up self-hack on rooted servers
            build hacknet, just purchase nodes and upgrade

        stage-2
            hack all port1 servers
            setup hack-manager-stage1 on "home" to target 'best' server based on [MATH]
                give servers a value rating based on [growth * (max money / min security + 1)] //it's super arbitrary but it should do until v2

        stage-3
            purchase servers, start with 8gb / loop replacing when current purchased server RAM * 2 is < 1/8 of current money on 'home'
            hack-manager-stage2
                this one pawns off grow and weaken threads to purchased servers

        stage-4

==== Scripts Needed

# hacknet upgrade
    purchase as long as the cost of the hacknet upgrades if under 1/16 of avaliable money, 

# hack-manager-stage2
    # spider
        gets a list of all avaliable server
            filter for opened ports && root && required hack level
                exec waitRoot on servers that have not been rooted
    
    while true

        # server rank
            based on list of server, assign hack value [growth * (max money / min security + 1)]
            add top x to targets

        for target in targets
            weaken to min
                execs weaken threads to get server to min security, if enough threads not avalible on the server queue them up in batches
        
            grow to max
                execs grow threads to get server to max money

            weaken to min
                execs weaken threads to get server to min security

            hack to 50%
                execs hack threads to get 50% of the server's money

# hack-manager-stage3

# DAEMON 
    - if not joined factions at appropriate hack levels => popup
    - if not bought port openers at appropriate money || hack levels => toast


==== ARCHIVE
# self-hack
    convert the starting script
        expects the server to already be root
# setup-stage1
    copies self-hack to array of servers
    runs build-hacknet
# build hacknet
    buys hacknet nodes and upgraded them as longs as the price is under 1/4 of the money on 'home'
